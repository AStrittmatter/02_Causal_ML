# Causal Machine Learning Course Materials

This repository contains PDF lecture materials for a course on causal machine learning, which covers fundamental and advanced topics related to causal inference and machine learning techniques.

**Lecture Content:**

- Confounders with Machine Learning: This lecture discusses methods for identifying and adjusting for confounding variables using machine learning algorithms, improving the validity of causal inferences.
- Heterogeneity in Machine Learning: This section covers approaches to estimate and understand heterogeneous treatment effects across different subgroups or populations.
- Optimal Policy Learning: This lecture introduces strategies for deriving optimal policy decisions based on causal inference and data-driven methods.
- Reinforcement Learning: Explore the application of reinforcement learning techniques in causal analysis, focusing on decision-making processes over time.
